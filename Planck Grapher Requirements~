******Planck Equation Grapher******

Description:
The Planck Equation Grapher will take a temperature from the user using a slider, calculate the intensity of black body radiation it emits at different wavelengths and plot the spectral intensity curve with spectral radiance on the y axis and wavelength on the x-axis. The grapher will also display the color of light seen by the eye for the temperature selected by the user.

Requirements:
1. The program shall allow the user to select a temperature using a slider
2. The program shall calculate the spectral intensity radiated by an object of the selected temperature at 200 wavelengths of 0 to 1.5 		micrometers
3. The program shall display the calculated intensities on a line graph.
4. The program shall display the total radiated energy at the specified temperature.
5. The program shall display the color of light seen by the human eye at the specified temperature.
